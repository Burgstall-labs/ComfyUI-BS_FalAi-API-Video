# ComfyUI-BS_FalAi-API-Video
## Experimental ComfyUI Custom Node for generating videos using various FAL AI API endpoints
I spent a day with Gemini and Claude to produce this, and it is certainly not perfect. My python expertise is elementary level. Further testing is needed, but at least Kling and Wan endpoints have been tested and work fine.

## Installation:
- git clone https://github.com/Burgstall-labs/ComfyUI-BS_FalAi-API-Video
- cd custom_nodes/ComfyUI-BS_FalAi-API-Video
- pip install -r requirements.txt

- Log in to your fal.ai account and make a key: https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys
- Paste this key into the node in the field for it.

## Please note:
-Not all of the endpoints have been tested. 

-Not all of the endpoints utilise all of the parameters shown by the node; please refer to the API page of the endpoint in question to learn more about the parameters exposed.
